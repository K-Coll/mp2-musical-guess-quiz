## User Experience (UX)
### Strategy
The Musical Guess Quiz is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices. It allows users to guess which artists sang the specified lyrics.

### User Stories 
  * #### Site Owner Goals
    1.   
    2. 

  * #### First Time Visitor Goals
    3. 
    4. 

  * #### Returning Visitor Goals
    6. 
    7. 
  
  
### Scope
  The goal for the project is to make a response, easy to use and visually appealing interactive website.  

### Structure
  Overall the website has four pages. These are:  

*  **Page 1**  
    Brief Info about page 1

*  **Page 2**  
    Brief Info about page 2

*  **Page 3**  
    Brief Info about page 3

*  **Page 4**  
    Brief Info about page 4
  
### Skeleton

  Wireframes were created for this project using Balsamic. For each page, a wireframe was created for mobile, tablet and desktop. I tried to stick to this design as close as possible for the final project.

  ### Surface

* #### Design
    The overall design of the website is minimal.
  
      <br>
      <details><summary>Feature </summary>
      <img src="">
      </details>  
      <br>  
      <details><summary>Feature </summary>
      <img src="">
      </details>  
      <br>  
      <details><summary>Feature </summary>
      <img src="">
      </details>  
      <br>  
      <details><summary>Feature </summary>
      <img src="">
      </details>  
 
* #### Colour Scheme
    The idea for the colour scheme is to keep it fresh and bright, whilst also being easy to read and understand.

    The overall design of the website is minimalistic; only four main colours are used. This is purposeful so as not to take away focus on the images used within the website and also not the clash with them. The background images used have lots of complimentary colours which creates an overall cohesive and pleasing aesthetic.  

    <details><summary>Colour Palette</summary>
    <img src="">
    </details>

* #### Contrast Checker
    Contrast was checked for accessibility using WebAIM's contrast checker - https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.  
    <br>
    Info about the contrast checker results 

    <details><summary>Contrast Checker </summary>
    <img src="">

    <details><summary>Contrast Checker </summary>
    <img src="">
    </details>

* #### Typography
    Info about the fonts used and why
    
    Three fonts are used for this website.  
    
    Kalam is used for the website title / logo, for the contact link within the footer and for the submit button. Rubik is used for the menu navigation bar and the headings. Nunito Sans is used for the main body of the website.  
    
    Sans Serif was also used as the fall-back font throughout the entire website, if the other fonts are not working properly.  
    
    These fonts are accessible and were chosen because they are clear and easy to read and are popular for people who have visual or cognitive disabilities.  

* #### Imagery
    Explain the images used and what you wanted to create from this 
    
    The type of imagery used on the website is sourced from Freepik.com, specifically:  
            * [Image](link). From author [XXX](link)  
            * [Image](link). From author [XXX](link)  
            * [Image](link) from author [XXX](link)  
   

* #### Media
Reference any mediam font awesome icons, etc

## Future Implementations

## Accessibility
I have tried to ensure the website is as accessible as possible by:
* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes for images throughout the website.
* Using easy to read and accessible fonts.
* Adding aria-labels for screen readers.
* Using a cohesive design scheme and colour contrasts to make sure the text is easy to read.
* Using clear navigation.  

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website meets high accessibility standards. All pages of the website passsed with zero errors.
